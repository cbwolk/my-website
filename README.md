Assignment 1: My Portfolio

Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to create a
         basic webpage using HTML and CSS to hold my
         picture, resume, and bio.
        
Files:
         index.html
         bio.html
         resume.html
         style.css
         (coltonwolk.jpeg)
         
Process: I started by building a page in just HTML, so 
         that I could get the content up. Then, I began 
         trying to link the files together and redirect my
         Tufts site to my Github. After that, I focued on 
         styling and making the site better. Finally, I
         validated the site and made changes accordingly. 
         In the future, I should validate more frequently so
         I won't have to make such large edits at the end.
