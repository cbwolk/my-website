# COMP 20 Reflection

## Purpose

This git repository is intended to showcase my work from COMP 20 at Tufts 
University, taught by Ming Chow.

## Favorite Assignment

I enjoyed creating the Lyft Knockoff service (front end), as it was a fun and
informative introduction to JavaScript and other concepts covered in the class.

## How I've Grown

Before the class, I had some experience with web development but didn't really
have a good understanding of what was actually happening behind the scenes. 
This class taught me that important part I was missing, though there is
still a lot more to learn.

## Most Important Things I've learned

I've learned how to learn by doing and by asking questions, as many of the
assignments in the course--as mentioned in class--are purposely vague and 
forced me to think more deeply, research online, and ask questions to figure
out how to do it. This was especially true is the semster group project,
where my group is working with very complex technologies and services, and 
also for Assignment 3, which I found to be challenging.


## What Else I want to Learn

I would like to gain an even more thorough understanding of the networks, in
addition to persuring other interests in CS such as algorithms and machine
learning. This class, even though it related to web development, taught
me many skills about how to challenge myself and work collaboratively, which
will be useful in all of my future persuits in CS and beyond.
