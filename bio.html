        <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
            <p>I have an extensive background in programming, including data structures, algorithms, and web/mobile development. I completed courses at Princeton University while in high school, and I worked with a lecturer to develop an assignment for future courses. I am a strong and experienced leader, currently on the executive board for the Computer Science Exchange and formerly a Peer Leader at my high school. I seek to study advanced computer science topics, including general theory and string/pattern matching algorithms. I plan on engaging in research throughout my time at Tufts. </p>

            <p>I am also passionate about sustainability and the environment, exhibited by my involvement with the Climate Action and Renewable Energy clubs. Furthermore, I have enjoyed studying Chinese language and culture and intend to become fluent in Chinese and to study abroad in China.</p>
