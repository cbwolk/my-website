                                <p>My project allows you to scrape Home Depot&#39;s website for product information and interact with a chatbot via Slack to answer questions about those products. The main files are <code>scraping.py</code> and <code>server.py</code>. The <code>requirements.txt</code> file lists necessary packages and <code>ProductList.csv</code> contains a list of nearly 700 products that have been scraped already. That list makes for a sufficient demonstration of how the chatbot works.

                                <p> <strong>NOTE: Please contact me if you would like to test out the bot. I would be happy to add you to the Slack workspace and give you access to the proper files. You may also peruse my presentation above for more details and an example of it in action.</strong></p>
                                <h2 id="files">Files</h2>
                                <h3 id="-scraping-py-"><code>scraping.py</code></h3>
                                <p>The Home Depot sitemap is constructed in multiple layers. There is a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/sitemap/P/PIPs.xml">parent link</a> of all products and two subcategories. In other words, this is how you get to a product page:</p>
                                <p>PIP XML link (above) &mdash;&gt; XML link &mdash;&gt; XML link &mdash;&gt; Product page</p>
                                <p>In the file, I iterate through each product page to get the product information, if available. For simplicity, only the most important deatails are scraped, including the product&#39;s name, price, basic information, rating, and number of reviews. The information is formatted and saved into <code>ProductList.csv</code></p>
                                <h3 id="-server-py-"><code>server.py</code></h3>
                                <p>This is where the magic happens! Using Langchain, the CSV data is loaded into the chatbot based on OpenAI&#39;s GPT 3.5-turbo model. The file also includes necessary functions to integrate with Slack, enabling localhost port 3000 to accept and reply to Slack requests, generating relevant output based on the data and the user&#39;s question. The bot remembers previous messages sent and received in the same session.</p>

                                      Scan product pages to enumerate all possible XPaths or <code>class</code> names of features like price, reviews, etc. Some products have the details in different locations, and I may have missed some.

                                   <li>Optimize the way the product data is processed into the model by adjusting the size of the text splitting, etc.</li>
                                   <li>Add additional features for the bot in the workspace, such as enabling it to work in DMs, threads, etc.</li>
                                   <li>Store product information in a database, and maintain a history of chat messages that persists longer than the temporary server&#39;s session. Currently, the data and memory are transient. </li>
                                </ul>
